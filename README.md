# Java Developer Internship – Task 3

## 📌 Task Title  
Control Flow Based Student Result System

---

## 🎯 Objective  
The objective of this task is to design and implement a console-based Java application that processes student marks and displays results using control flow statements such as if-else, switch-case, loops, break, and continue. This task helps in understanding how program flow is controlled in real-world scenarios.

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- OpenJDK (JDK 8+)  
- Visual Studio Code / IntelliJ IDEA  
- Command Prompt / Terminal  
- GitHub (for submission)

## 🧪 What I Did  

1. Designed a console-based student result processing system in Java.  
2. Took student marks as input for multiple subjects using `Scanner`.  
3. Implemented validation logic to ensure marks are between 0 and 100.  
4. Used loops to allow entry of multiple students.  
5. Calculated total marks and percentage using a separate method.  
6. Assigned grades using `switch-case` based on percentage.  
7. Displayed final result summary including total, percentage, grade, and pass/fail status.  
8. Used `break` and `continue` statements to control program flow.  
9. Refactored repeated logic into methods for better readability and reusability.

## 📄 Program Output  

The program displays the student’s total marks, percentage, grade, and result status.

Example:
```

--- Result Summary ---
Total Marks   : 433
Percentage    : 86.6%
Grade         : B
Result        : PASS

```
